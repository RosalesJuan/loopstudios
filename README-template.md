### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
## My process
I began with adding the necessary files into a new folder. I set up CSS and SCSS style files. Following the images provided by Frontend Mentor, I started writing HTML code. The HTML code was not a long process. Moving into styling, the tricky part was to adding the heading at the top of the page. I used an absolute position, but that became a bit of an issue for smaller screens, because I had to move the title at every breakpoint. Similar issue with the Interactive VR section. I am guessing there's a better solution, I did not look into it too much because it was not complicated just a bit tidious.
The other issue showed up in the card's section, the challenge was to have the cards be partially visible and show all once the "SEE ALL" button was pressed. Using Javascript I hid part of the section, and when the button was pressed I changed the container's height to 100%; 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
### What I learned

The first site in which I created a hamburger for tablets and mobile screens. It wasn't very hard, but it did take a some time to fully understand. The hover effect on the navigation bar was also new. And more practice with CSS;

### Continued development
Working on future challenges, I want to create better responsive pages, and more fluent looking sites. Also learn more tricks using CSS, and practicing more JavaScript;
